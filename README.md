## How do I use it?
> Note: When you run this program for the first time, it will download some models ~300MB in size.

Executing `python run.py` command will launch this window:

Working command line arguments are given below:

```
options:
  
  --gpu                 use gpu

```

For now recommendation is to use: 'python run.py' without gpu options since the code not commited yet.
